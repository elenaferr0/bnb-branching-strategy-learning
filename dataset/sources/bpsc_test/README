Set of randomly generated problems (test set): 50 problems

The problems contain two types of constraints
 - bin packing constraints: a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + ... + a_n x_n <= b, with x_i binary, a_i in R
 - set covering constraints: - a_1 x_1 - a_2 x_2 - ... - a_n x_n <= -1, with x_i binary, and a_i in {0, 1}

The number of variables, the number of constraints, and the parameters of the
problems are generated randomly from uniform distributions.

Note that all problems are in the standard form, i.e.,

  min c^T x
  s.t. Ax <= b
