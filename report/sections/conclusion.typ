= Conclusion
The results of these experiments are positive, albeit still quite improvable. For instance, the training set could be expanded to include more diverse instances, which would likely help the models
generalize better.
Moreover, hyperparameter tuning could be refined further to verify whether it's possible to achieve better performances.
Finally, solving larger instances, such as the whole MIPLIB benchmark, would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the trained estimators.
